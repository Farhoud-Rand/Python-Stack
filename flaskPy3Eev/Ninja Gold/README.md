# Ninja Gold Game

This is a mini game that allows a ninja to earn gold by visiting different places (farm, cave, house, casino). The ninja can earn or lose different amounts of gold at each location. The game keeps track of the ninja's gold balance and past activities.

## About

In this game, the ninja starts with 0 gold and can visit different locations to earn gold. Each location has its own chance of earning gold, with the casino having the highest risk but also the potential for the highest reward.

## Features

- Four separate forms for the ninja to choose from (farm, cave, house, casino).
- Activities log displaying past activities with color-coded entries (+ gold is green, - gold is red).
- Ability to reset the game and start over.
- Activities displayed in descending order (most recent activity first).
